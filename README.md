# Drawer organizer for Mach 3 blade holders

## Motivation

* When you buy these at the big-box store, you wind up with 4 plastic containers, each with 5 blades
* They don't click together, they just slide around in your drawer
* I thought it would be nicer if I could 3D print a box
* I know a bit about OpenSCAD
* I'm learning about ChatGPT
* Let's experiment with ChatGPT's 3D modelling abilities, to see if it can generate a workable model.
